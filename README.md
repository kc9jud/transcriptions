# transcriptions
Here you can find transcriptions of the Chants (mostly from Graduale Triplex) with St. Gallen neumatic notation.

For every PDF file there is a GABC file too, with NABC notation included.

The files are produced using GREGORIO software - https://gregorio-project.github.io/

The TEX file used for compiling is main.tex
